Cybersecurity focuses on protecting digital systems and data by maintaining the CIA Triad—confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Real-world incidents show that weak access controls, disabled integrity checks, and ransomware attacks can severely impact organizations and users. Different attacker types, from script kiddies to nation-state actors, exploit various attack surfaces such as web apps, mobile apps, APIs, networks, and cloud infrastructure. Everyday applications like email, messaging, and banking apps are frequent targets, proving that reducing attack surfaces and applying strong security controls is essential to protect sensitive data and ensure reliable digital services.
